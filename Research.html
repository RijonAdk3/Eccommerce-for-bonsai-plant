            As to make the website attractive and informative we researched on different websites that sells Bonsai Plants.
            I felt that the Home, Product, Contact Us and blog in nav bar should change its colour while hovering the mouse 
            on it which i found in the reference website. Hence, I applied the hover effect to it but I included red colour
            to be in its background when cursor is hovered upon it so that it can be viewed easily by the users and make it 
            attractive. In this way I applied better background color when hovered in my home page.

                During the designing of product page for our website I have been through some
                website which is the part of my research too. The website were good but in comparison
                with our Forever Green, our website contains more important and unique features
                which will make customers experience excellent because we have added attractive
                features like flipping images which shows details of bonsai plant including its rating
                and price which other website lacked.

            During the designing of About Us page for our website, I have been through some other 
            website which is the part of my research too. I have searched many website and looked at their
            about us page but i found that there is something missing. They did not give details in 
            short instead there is large paragraphs which is boring to read. The portfolio of CEO were missing
            and looking at the feedback form they did not give option to select which is your favourite bonsai plant.
            So we have given the option to select favourite bonsai plant  which help us to interact with customers 
            and know about the favourite bonsai plant of the customer.

            During the designing of the Blog Page for our website, I have been through some other
            website for comparing and analyzing what should i include unique and informative things 
            in my page than other websites. I found that the blog page consists only paragraph in 
            which seems to be boring so i have added small paragraph but important information through
             the pointwise using ordered list and unordered list as well as table.
